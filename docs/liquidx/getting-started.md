LiquidX Getting Started
==========

LiquidX enables DAPP Network services to be used between chains.  A user can stake DAPP on the EOS mainnet for an account on another eosio based chain.  

This is accomplished by creating a set of mappings between accounts.  DSPs and Users must create a 2 way mapping where by they verify on the mainnet and on the chain in question that each account is linked.  This topic is explored in more detail in the docs to follow.
