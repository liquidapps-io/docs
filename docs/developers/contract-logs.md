Contract Logs
========

The DAPP Network uses custom event logs to communicate between consumer contracts and the DAPP Service Providers (specialized EOSIO nodes running the DAPP Network logic and servicing requests). Â For this reason any print statements added to a contract which utilizes a DAPP Network service must end with a newline (`\n`) in order to not interfere with the event parsing.

For example:

```cpp
print("{\"type\":\"debug\",\"message\":\"YOUR LOGS HERE\"}\n");
```

```cpp
print("Hello World!");
print("\n");
```
