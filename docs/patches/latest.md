========

### [LiquidVRAM Service](https://docs.liquidapps.io/en/v2.0/services/ipfs-service.html)
- add new service responses and requests when `#define USE_ADVANCED_IPFS` is used
- add warmuprow and cleanuprow, these allow for more efficient loading and cleaning of vram shard information
- add warmupcode, which allows for vram to be accessed from external contracts and third party DSPs
- warmupcode is used automatically when required when the `code` specified in a multi-index table is something other than `self`

### [@liquidapps/dsp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/dsp)
- update get table row secodary index changes in 2.0
- cease support for pre nodeos 2.0 nodes
- added max pending messages for demux to prevent memory crashes
- fixed demux get starting block logic, added possibility for head block
- fixes
    - fix demux head block handler using brackets
    - support new `/v1/chain/send_transaction` endpoint in addition to `/v1/chain/push_transaction`

### [@liquidapps/zeus-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/zeus-cmd)
- split mapping into builtin and local file stored in ~/.zeus/ storage directory
- boxes added to the mapping using zeus deploy box and zeus box add go to the local mapping file to persist between zeus updates
- when unboxing a box found in both files, the local mapping is given priority, but a warning is displayed
- added zeus box remove command to remove boxes from the local mapping
- added RC file ignore flag --rc-ignore to bypass it | [thank you prcolaco](https://github.com/liquidapps-io/zeus-sdk/pull/9)

Example `zeusrc.json`:
```json
{
    "verbose": true,
    "type": "local",
    "update-mapping": true,
    "test": true
}
```
- added utility/tool for deserializing `xvexec` data (vaccount action data)
Example:
`deserializeVactionPayload('dappaccoun.t', '6136465e000000002a00000000000000aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e90600000000000000008090d9572d3ccdcd002370ae375c19feaa49e0d336557df8aa49010000000000000004454f5300000000026869', 'https://mainnet.eos.dfuse.io')`
returns
```json
{
   "payload":{
      "expiry":"1581659745",
      "nonce":"42",
      "chainid":"ACA376F206B8FC25A6ED44DBDC66547C36C6C33E3A119FFBEAEF943642F0E906",
      "action":{
         "account":"",
         "action_name":"transfervacc",
         "authorization":[

         ],
         "action_data":"70AE375C19FEAA49E0D336557DF8AA49010000000000000004454F5300000000026869"
      }
   },
   "deserializedAction":{
      "payload":{
         "vaccount":"dapjwaewayrb",
         "to":"dapjkzepavdy",
         "quantity":"0.0001 EOS",
         "memo":"hi"
      }
   }
}
```
- add RC file to load regular zeus-cmd options from, on ~/.zeus/zeusrc.json by default, changeable with --rc-file option | [thank you prcolaco](https://github.com/liquidapps-io/zeus-sdk/pull/9)
- `zeus create contract <MY_CONTRACT>` now creates `MY_CONTRACT.cpp` instead of `main.cpp`, update cmake to use `MY_CONTRACT.cpp`
- use v2.0.2 nodeos
- fixes
    - fix portfolio app requesting new oracle entries twice on load
    - fix portfolio app double adding eos token balances
    - `Read past end of buffer` - The issue was that an additional parameter was added to IPFS warmup to enable new functionality. This caused a conflict for pre-existing contracts attempting to warmup IPFS data. The parameter was removed.
    - fixed and refactored `get-table` utility to work with new dsp api (`get_uri`) and nodeos >= 2.0.0.

### [@liquidapps/dapp-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/dapp-client)

### [docs](https://docs.liquidapps.io/en/stable/)
- update to using nodeos v2+, pre 2.0 no longer supported
- add `developers/contract-logs` section and add details on DSP logs
- add `/liquidx/models/eosio-chains/${CHAIN_ACCOUNT}.json` section to consumer liquidx docs

### [LiquidX](https://docs.liquidapps.io/en/stable/liquidx.html)
- Service contracts and service contract mapping no longer mandatory
    - If a service contract is not mapped, it will default to the same name as the mainnet

### [dappservices contract](http://bloks.io/account/dappservices)
- Moved quota calculation logic into dappservices
- Deprecated individual service contracts for quota management, i.e. `ipfsservice1`,`cronservices`, etc
    - Providers that have already registered packages will have their RAM freed using a new `freeprovider(provider)` action
- billing will default to 0.0001 QUOTA for all actions
    - This allows for new actions to be added to services
- use `pricepkg` action to price action in quota
- add @eosio.code note for dappservicex and consumer contracts in liquidx section

### [LiquidStorage for LiquidAccounts PR](https://github.com/liquidapps-io/zeus-sdk/pull/18) - thank you https://github.com/MrToph
- Added `public_upload_vaccount` endpoint. This endpoint can be used directly from the frontend by vaccounts. The vaccount signs the file to upload, sends it to the DSP, which verifies and stores the file. Optionally, it does some additional quota checks defined by the consumer contract: It can define max file sizes, daily global upload limits, and daily limits on a per vaccount level.
- Added a `storageconsumer` contract testing the vaccount uploads + limits checking.
- Refactored the `upload_public` endpoint to a `common.js` file as most functionality is now also required by the new `upload_public_vaccount` endpoint.
- Added two quick-fix options `external` and `box` to the `sync-builtin-boxes` command, because it did not work with the public zeus-sdk repo. External should be set to true when using the public repo. The default args are chosen in a way that they shouldnâ€™t change anything if invoked as usual.
- changed the uploads to use base64 encoding instead of hex (in both dapp-client and server) to save some bandwidth. Fixed the bytelength quota calculation
- Disable vaccount archive upload
- Use base64 as encoding for archive as well to match other encodings.
- Support public archive upload in dapp-client lib
- fixes
    - Fix archive upload test
