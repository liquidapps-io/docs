**DAPP Token Inflation Tuning**
### [Packages](https://docs.liquidapps.io/en/v2.0/dsps/packages.html)
- it is now possible for the community to actively tune the DAPP Token Inflation rate
- this inflation tuning is facilitated by DSP's creating new packages that have a configurable desired inflation rate. any changes to the DAPP Token's inflation rate is in effect for all providers
- all existing packages retain the default annual inflation rate of 2.71%
- a new package may select any rate between 0.0 and 5.0%
- DAPP Token holders participate in the tuning mechanism by staking to packages that have an inflation rate they support
- the final inflation rate is calculated as a weighted average of DAPP staked to specific inflation rates
- a new table `packagext` has been added to store a packages selected inflation rate and quota cost for actions, which is indexed by `package_id`, `service`, and `provider`
- the DAPP token inflation rate is recalculated with every `stake` and `refund` action
- package inflation rates may not be changed after they are registered

**breaking changes**
- to use new dfuse push_transaction, must compile consumer contract with new version of dappservices contract
- if DSP package is not enabled in package table, signaled with boolean "1", then service will throw error on DSP, DSP package may be enabled with the `enablepkg` command: https://bloks.io/account/dappservices?loadContract=true&tab=Actions&account=dappservices&scope=dappservices&limit=100&action=enablepkg

- use eos 2.0.5
- update documentation to support `zeus_boxes` refactor
- add `chain-threads=8` `eos-vm-oc-compile-threads=2` to nodeos example `config.ini` in docs
- add [LiquidStorage section](../developers/storage-getting-started)
- update [LiquidAccounts section](../developers/vaccounts-getting-started)
- update [LiquidVRAM section](../developers/vram-getting-started)
- add `get_table_packagext` and `get_table_packagext_by_package_service_provider` to dapp-client section
- add `http-max-response-time-ms = 500` to config.ini settings to avoid `deadline 2020-07-20T18:07:39.110 exceeded by 10us` error

### [@liquidapps/zeus-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/zeus-cmd)
- use 8887 instead of 8889 for state history port to match DSP docs
- skip `01-dapp-client.js` if built
- add price feed example, price feed uses LiquidHarmony's oracles and LiquidScheduler's cron to fetch a price periodically and only use CPU when the price has changed from the last recorded price by more or less than 1%
- add `'--eos-vm-oc-compile-threads=4'` and `--chain-threads=4` to local nodeos
- update `zeus` to modularize logic into `zeus_boxes` directory making `zeus` more like `npm`, to create or unbox a new box start with `zeus box create [name]` then if you wish to unbox and existing box `zeus unbox <BOX>`
- zeus now offers versioning of boxes
    - zeus now offers optional `zeus unbox <BOX>@[VERSION]`
    - can add and remove boxes with `zeus box add <BOX> [VERSION] [URI]` `zeus box remove <BOX> [VERSION]`
    - to update an existing box, run `zeus unbox <BOX>@[VERSION]`, if no version specified, latest used, will unbox everything again with new version
    - to only add new boxes, unbox after update with `--no-update`
- add `zeus start-localenv --phase 01-dapp-client` --phase option to target start a specific phase of the localenv
- fixes
    - if Mac, detect and skip `--eos-vm-oc-enable` flags as they are not supported
    - fix endpoint link for `replay-contract.js` file
- document ability to use dfuse for cleanup script
- add typescript compile step for dfuse
- add `zeus box create` section to zeus getting started section
- update LiquidStorage upload file example with new params
- add `eth_keys_per_consumer = [{EVM_PRIVATE_KEY_CONSUMER1:PRIVATE_KEY_HERE}, {EVM_PRIVATE_KEY_CONSUMER2:PRIVATE_KEY_HERE}]` to toml
- prevent non-broadcast action from being broadcast
- add sidechain section to replay contract

### [@liquidapps/zeus-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/zeus-cmd)
- add `testfetch` price feed action / unit test for only using LiquidHarmony oracles for price feed fetch
- add unit test for 0s unstake time dappservices
- copy contracts and test folder to root so that `zeus_boxes` directory can be git ignored 
- add `enablepkg` command to dappservices unit tests
- fixes
    - add `parseFloat` to `test rewards` `dappservices` unit test

### [@liquidapps/dsp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquidapps/dsp)
- add option to use dfuse web socket and dfuse push_transaction guarantee in place of demux state history node on main DSP instance and supported side chains
    - this enables a DSP to not use a SHiP node and to instead read on chain events from dfuse and to push transactions using dfuse's push_guarantee making transactions more reliable, a free API key is suitable enough to support low levels of traffic
    - to use the dfuse backend, under the new dfuse section of the toml file, set `enable` to true and provide an api key
    - to use the dfuse push guarantee, set the `push_enable` to true and provide a dfuse api key
    - to use both, enable both
    - add dfuse section `network` to toml, select supported dfuse network: testnet (eosio testnet), kylin, worbli, wax
    - add `debug` to dfuse section to enable dfuse debug logs 
- if dsp `head_block` set to 0, dsp will pull head block from `get_info` RPC call automatically for demux
- throw error if package not enabled for DSP services
- enable cleanup script support for sidechain
- add `authorization` option under dfuse to use the EOS Nation community edition: https://t.me/dfusece | https://eos.dfuse.eosnation.io/
- add `replay-contract-hyperion.js` | thank you to Christoph Michel
- add `max_request_retries` option to config.toml, specifies how many times to retry a blocking DSP actions such as an IPFS warmup or oracle request
- add `liquidstorage_upload_limit` to config.toml, allows specification of Liquidstorage upload size limit
- add [https://www.npmjs.com/package/eosio-push-guarantee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eosio-push-guarantee) to DSP eos-wrapper.js
- fixes
    - add better error handling to CONFIRMING USAGE
    - fix async/await procesFn issue
