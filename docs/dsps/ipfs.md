IPFS
====

The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.  The DSPs utilize this as the storage layer to request and serve information to and from vRAM <> RAM as a caching solution.

ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001
ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080
cat <<EOF > /lib/systemd/system/ipfs.service

exit
```

### Adding Peers

To connect with your peers you may open port 4001 to the selected IPs that you wish to communicate with or open the port to all addresses.

#### Bootstrap Peers | [Documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/examples/bootstrap/)

Bootstrap peers default to IPFS nodes provided by the core development team.  They are scattered across the world.  These peers are what your IPFS node will initially monitor upon startup.  You may add our mainnet and kylin testnet IPFS nodes with the following commands:

```sh
# kylin

ipfs bootstrap add /ip4/52.70.167.190/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmZ5gLTZwvfD5DkbbaFFX4YJCi7f4C5oQAgq8qpjL8S1ur
ipfs bootstrap add /ip4/34.224.152.33/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmcCX4b3EF3eXaDe5dgxTL9mXbyci4FwcJAjWqpub5vCXM
```

#### Swarm Peers | [Documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/api/cli/#ipfs-swarm-connect)

Swarm peers are addresses that the local daemon will listen on for connections from other IPFS peers. They are what your IPFS node will look to first when requesting a file that is not cached locally.  [Both your node as well as the node you are trying to connect to](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6271) must run the following commands:

```sh
# kylin

ipfs swarm connect /ip4/52.70.167.190/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmZ5gLTZwvfD5DkbbaFFX4YJCi7f4C5oQAgq8qpjL8S1ur
ipfs swarm connect /ip4/34.224.152.33/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmcCX4b3EF3eXaDe5dgxTL9mXbyci4FwcJAjWqpub5vCXM
```

#### Reconnecting Periodically | [Medium Article](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-keep-your-ipfs-nodes-connected-and-ensure-fast-content-discovery-7d92fb23da46)

Peers have a tendency to disconnect from each other if not reconnected manually periodically, so to combat this, you may add the following two files to periodically reconnect to your swarm peers.

```bash
sudo su -
cat <<EOF > /lib/systemd/system/gateway-connector.service
[Unit]
Description=Job that periodically connects this IPFS node to the gateway node
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs swarm connect <ADD_MULTIPLE_CONNECTIONS_HERE_SPACE_SEPARATED> # /ip4/52.70.167.190/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmZ5gLTZwvfD5DkbbaFFX4YJCi7f4C5oQAgq8qpjL8S1ur /ip4/34.224.152.33/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmcCX4b3EF3eXaDe5dgxTL9mXbyci4FwcJAjWqpub5vCXM
Environment="IPFS_PATH=/root/.ipfs"
EOF
exit
```

```bash
sudo su -
cat <<EOF > /lib/systemd/system/gateway-connector.timer
[Unit]
Description=Timer that periodically triggers gateway-connector.service
[Timer]
OnBootSec=3min
OnUnitActiveSec=1min
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF
exit
```

Now you can enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gateway-connector.timer
sudo systemctl start gateway-connector.timer
```

To double checked this worked, run:

```bash
systemctl list-timers
```

You should see an entry for your gateway connector service. You can also check the status of its last execution attempt by running:

```bash
systemctl status gateway-connector
```

Finally you can monitor the process with:

```bash
journalctl -f | grep ipfs
```

#### Running a private network | [Documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/api/cli/#ipfs-bootstrap-rm-all)

Running a private IPFS network is possible by removing all default IPFS bootstrap peers and only adding those of your private network.

```sh
ipfs bootstrap rm all - Remove all peers from the bootstrap list
```

## Cluster

### IPFS-Cluster | [Documentation](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/)

### Bootsrapping from an existing IPFS Cluster | [Documentation](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/quickstart/#quickstart-starting-enlarging-and-shrinking-a-cluster)

IPFS is designed so that a node only stores files locally that are specifically requested.  The following is one way of populating a new IPFS node with all existing files from a pre-existing node.

To do so, first create a secret from `node0`, the original node, then share that secret with `node1`, the node you want to bootstrap from `node0`.  Then `node1` runs the bootstrap command specifying the cluster's address and setting the `CLUSTER_SECRET` as an env variable.

#### node0

* `export CLUSTER_SECRET=$(od  -vN 32 -An -tx1 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' \n')`
* `echo $CLUSTER_SECRET`
* `ipfs-cluster-service init`
* `ipfs-cluster-service daemon`

#### node1 (bootstrapping from node0)

* `export CLUSTER_SECRET=<copy from node0>`
* `ipfs-cluster-service init`
* `ipfs-cluster-service daemon --bootstrap /ip4/192.168.1.2/tcp/9096/ipfs/QmZjSoXUQgJ9tutP1rXjjNYwTrRM9QPhmD9GHVjbtgWxEn` // replace with what you see from running node0's daemon
* `ipfs-cluster-ctl peers ls` check your peers to see you've added node0 correctly

#### node0
* if you want to remove a peer after the bootstrapping is complete, the following command will do that and shut down the IPFS cluster
* `ipfs-cluster-ctl peers rm QmYFYwnFUkjFhJcSJJGN72wwedZnpQQ4aNpAtPZt8g5fCd`
